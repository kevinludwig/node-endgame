[FEN "4k3/R7/8/3KP3/8/8/8/7r b - - 1 1"]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]

{When the king is blocking the pawn, Philidor laid out the drawing method: The black rook occupies the 
third rank, preventing the white king's advance. When the pawn moves to the sixth rank, Black's rook
moves to the first rank, and white faces perpetual checks or the loss of the pawn.}
